# B9PartSwitch

A Kerbal Space Program plugin designed to implement switching of part meshes, resources, and nodes

This mod will not change anything by itself, but is designed to be used by other mods to enable part subtype switching

## Requirements

* KSP version 1.1.2 (build 1260) is the only supported KSP version
* [ModuleManager](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?showtopic=50533) is required.

## Installation

* Remove any previous installation of B9PartSwitch

## Changelog


### v1.4.3

* Recompile against KSP 1.1.3
* Remove some code which is unnecessary in KSP 1.1.3

### v1.4.2

* Fix TweakScale interaction - resource amounts did not account for scaling (broken since v1.4.0)

### v1.4.1

* Fix bug where we were setting maxTemp when we should have been setting skinMaxTemp or crashTolerance

### v1.4.0

* Find best subtype intelligently
  * If subtype name was previously set, use it to find the correct subtype (allows subtypes to be reordered without breaking craft)
  * If name was not previously set or not found, but index was, use it (this allows transitioning from current setup and renaming subtypes if necessary)
  * If index was not previously set, try to infer subtype based on part's resources (this allows easy transitioning from a non-switching setup)
  * Finally, just use first subtype
* Add unit testing for subtype finding
* Get rid of some unnecessary logging in debug mode
* Refactor part switching a bit

### v1.3.1

* Fix bug where having ModuleB9PartInfo on a root part would cause physics to break due to an exception (really a stock issue but no sense waiting for a fix)

### v1.3.0

* Do not destroy incompatible fuel switchers.  Instead, disable fuel switching
* Allow part's crash tolerance to be edited
* Add info module to display changes to part in the info window.  Only displays things that can be changed.
* Various internal changes

### v1.2.0

* Support TweakScale integration
* Allow plural switcher description (in part catalog) to be edited)
* Disable changing surface attach node size (problematic with Tweakscale)

### v1.1.4

* Don't remove FSfuelSwitch or InterstellarFuelSwitch if ModuleB9PartSwitch doesn't manage resources
* Defer rendering drag cubes until part has been attached (fixes flickering in editor)
* Avoid firing events multiple times
* Various internal changes

### v1.1.3

* Recompile against KSP 1.1.2
* Simplify part list info a bit
* Hopefully make some error messages clearer
* Various internal refactors and simplifications

### v1.1.2

* Remove FSmeshSwitch and InterstellarMeshSwitch from incompatible modules
* Recompile against KSP 1.1.1

### v1.1.1

* Fix resource cost not accounting for units per volume on tank type

### v1.1

* KSP 1.1 compatibility
* Fixed bug where having part switching on the root part would cause physics to break
* Moved UI controls to UI_ChooseOption
* Adjust default Monopropellant tank type to be closer to (new) stock values
* Use stock part mass modification
* Hopefully fix incompatible module checking
* Various refactors and simplifications which might improve performance a bit

### v1.0.1

* Fix NRE in flight scene

### v1.0.0

* Initial release
